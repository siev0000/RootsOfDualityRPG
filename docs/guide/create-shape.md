# Create Shape

## Why ?

A shape is an invisible zone on the map (it can be made visible, but not too interesting), which allows to trigger actions if you enter or leave this zone. The shape can be fixed or it can move on the map.
It is also possible to attach an area to a player/event. For example, create a vision system
